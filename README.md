# Beginner-Machine-Learning-Project-Python

We'll cover the full process of building a beginner machine learning project. This includes creating a hypothesis, setting up the model, and measuring error. By the end, we'll understand how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using Python and Jupyter.

To make this interesting, we'll use a fun dataset. We'll use data from historical Olympic games. We'll try to predict how many medals a country will win based on historical and current data.
